## C. Challenge Payment Questions

##### The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:
- monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
- upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
- upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
- once a customer churns they will no longer make payments

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS payments_2020;

CREATE TABLE payments_2020
SELECT s.customer_id,
	   s.plan_id,
       p.plan_name,
       s.start_date,
       p.price,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.customer_id ) AS payment_order
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions AS s
JOIN foodie_fi.plans AS p
USING (plan_id)
WHERE plan_id != 0
AND plan_id != 4
AND s.start_date LIKE '2020%';

SELECT *
FROM foodie_fi.payments_2020;
```

## D. Outside The Box Questions

The following are open ended questions which might be asked during a technical interview for this case study - there are no right or wrong answers, but answers that make sense from both a technical and a business perspective make an amazing impression!

#### How would you calculate the rate of growth for Foodie-Fi?

To calculate the rate of growth for Foodie-Fi, you would need data on the number of customers or revenue over a specific period of time. 
The formula for calculating the growth rate is as follows:
</br>
<code> Growth Rate = ((Present Value - Past Value) / Past Value) * 100 </code>

- To do this I created another table <code> payments </code> which is prety much the same as <code> payments_2020 </code> table from Section C. 
This table however, does not specify a particular year

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS payments;

CREATE TABLE payments
SELECT s.customer_id,
	   s.plan_id,
       p.plan_name,
       s.start_date,
       p.price,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.customer_id ) AS payment_order
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions AS s
JOIN foodie_fi.plans AS p
USING (plan_id)
WHERE plan_id != 0
AND plan_id != 4;
```

- Growth rate in terms of customers who subscribed to a plan after the 7 days trial

```sql
SELECT
  ROUND(((total_customers_2021 - total_customers_2020) / total_customers_2020) * 100, 1) AS growth_rate
FROM
  (SELECT
  -- total number of customers who subscribed to a plan after the trial in 2021
	(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) 
	FROM foodie_fi.payments 
	WHERE YEAR(start_date) = 2021
	)AS total_customers_2021,
-- total number of customers who subscribed to a plan after the trial in 2020
    (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) 
	FROM foodie_fi.payments 
	WHERE YEAR(start_date) = 2020
	) AS total_customers_2020
  ) AS subquery;
```
![SD_Q1A](https://github.com/OmarCypha700/8WeekSQLChallenge/assets/98944012/ce440660-00bf-44a7-8f7b-612fe7408316)

A growth rate of -85.9% indicates a severe decline in the number of individuals subscribing to a payment plan after the 7 days free trial in 2021 as compared to 2020,
highlighting the need for immediate attention and corrective measures to reverse the negative trend and restore growth.

- Growth rate could also be calculated in terms of revenue

```sql
SELECT
  ROUND(((total_price_2021 - total_price_2020) / total_price_2020) * 100, 1) AS growth_rate
FROM
  (SELECT
  -- total revenue accumulated in 2021
    (SELECT SUM(price) FROM foodie_fi.payments WHERE YEAR(start_date) = 2021) AS total_price_2021,
-- total revenue accumulated in 2020
    (SELECT SUM(price) FROM foodie_fi.payments WHERE YEAR(start_date) = 2020) AS total_price_2020
  ) AS subquery;
``` 
![SD_Q1B](https://github.com/OmarCypha700/8WeekSQLChallenge/assets/98944012/f02f69f2-974a-4017-9a9e-8d2a73e1dd88)

A growth rate of -74.3% indicates a sharp decline in foodie_fi's revenue compared to the previous period (2020)

### What key metrics would you recommend Foodie-Fi management to track over time to assess performance of their overall business?

- #### Revenue: 
Monitoring the total revenue generated by Foodie-Fi on a regular basis. This may include subscription fees, advertising revenue, and any other sources of income. Tracking revenue will help assess the financial health and growth of the business.
- #### Customer Acquisition and Churn: 
Keeping track of the number of new customers acquired during a specific period and the rate at which customers are leaving (churn rate). This will help evaluate the effectiveness of marketing and customer retention strategies.
- #### Customer Satisfaction: 
Regularly measuring customer satisfaction through surveys, feedback, or ratings. Understanding customer satisfaction levels helps measure the overall quality of the service and identify areas for improvement.
