## A. Customer Nodes Exploration

#### How many unique nodes are there on the Data Bank system?

```sql

```


#### What is the number of nodes per region?

```sql

```

#### How many customers are allocated to each region?

```sql

```

#### How many days on average are customers reallocated to a different node?

```sql

```

#### What is the median, 80th and 95th percentile for this same reallocation days metric for each region?

```sql

```


## B. Customer Transactions

#### What is the unique count and total amount for each transaction type?

```sql

```

#### What is the average total historical deposit counts and amounts for all customers?

```sql

```

#### For each month - how many Data Bank customers make more than 1 deposit and either 1 purchase or 1 withdrawal in a single month?



#### What is the closing balance for each customer at the end of the month?

```sql

```


#### What is the percentage of customers who increase their closing balance by more than 5%?

```sql

```


## C. Data Allocation Challenge

#### To test out a few different hypotheses - the Data Bank team wants to run an experiment where different groups of customers would be allocated data using 3 different options:

- Option 1: data is allocated based off the amount of money at the end of the previous month
- Option 2: data is allocated on the average amount of money kept in the account in the previous 30 days
- Option 3: data is updated real-time
- 
#### For this multi-part challenge question - you have been requested to generate the following data elements to help the Data Bank team estimate how much data will need to be provisioned for each option:

- running customer balance column that includes the impact each transaction
- customer balance at the end of each month
- minimum, average and maximum values of the running balance for each customer

```sql

```

#### Using all of the data available - how much data would have been required for each option on a monthly basis?

```sql

```


## D. Extra Challenge

#### Data Bank wants to try another option which is a bit more difficult to implement. 
They want to calculate data growth using an interest calculation, just like in a traditional savings account you might have with a bank. 
If the annual interest rate is set at 6% and the Data Bank team wants to reward its customers by increasing their data allocation based off the interest calculated on a daily basis at the end of each day, how much data would be required for this option on a monthly basis?
#### Special notes:
Data Bank wants an initial calculation which does not allow for compounding interest, however they may also be interested in a daily compounding interest calculation so you can try to perform this calculation if you have the stamina!

```sql

```

In this query, the data allocation for each option is calculated by applying the interest rate to the respective balance values. 
Option 1 and Option 2 use a monthly interest rate, while Option 3 applies daily compounding interest over 30 days. 
The results are grouped by month to provide the data required for each option on a monthly basis.
