## A. Data Cleaning Steps

#### In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table in the data_mart schema named clean_weekly_sales:
- Convert the week_date to a DATE format

- Add a week_number as the second column for each week_date value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2 etc

- Add a month_number with the calendar month for each week_date value as the 3rd column

- Add a calendar_year column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values

- Add a new column called age_band after the original segment column using the following mapping on the number inside the segment value

- Add a new demographic column using the following mapping for the first letter in the segment values

- Ensure all null string values with an "unknown" string value in the original segment column as well as the new age_band and demographic columns

- Generate a new avg_transaction column as the sales value divided by transactions rounded to 2 decimal places for each record

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS clean_weekly_sales;

CREATE TABLE clean_weekly_sales AS
SELECT  
		STR_TO_DATE(week_date, '%d/%m/%y') AS week_date,
		WEEK(STR_TO_DATE(week_date, '%d/%m/%y')) AS week_number,

		YEAR(STR_TO_DATE(week_date, '%d/%m/%y')) AS calendar_year,
		region,
		platform,
        CASE WHEN segment LIKE 'C%' OR segment LIKE 'F%' THEN segment
             ELSE 'unkown' END AS segment,
		CASE 
			WHEN segment LIKE '%1' THEN 'Young Adults'
			WHEN segment LIKE '%2' THEN 'Middle Aged'

## C. Before & After Analysis

This technique is usually used when we inspect an important event and want to inspect the impact before and after a certain point in time.

Taking the week_date value of 2020-06-15 as the baseline week where the Data Mart sustainable packaging changes came into effect.

We would include all week_date values for 2020-06-15 as the start of the period after the change and the previous week_date values would be before

Using this analysis approach - answer the following questions:

#### What is the total sales for the 4 weeks before and after 2020-06-15? What is the growth or reduction rate in actual values and percentage of sales?

```sql
SELECT total_sales_before, 
       total_sales_after,
       (total_sales_before - total_sales_after) AS sales_difference,
       ROUND(((total_sales_after - total_sales_before) / total_sales_before) * 100, 1) AS growth_rate
FROM (SELECT
    SUM(CASE WHEN week_date BETWEEN DATE_SUB('2020-06-15', INTERVAL 4 WEEK) AND '2020-06-15' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS total_sales_before,
    SUM(CASE WHEN week_date BETWEEN '2020-06-15' AND DATE_ADD('2020-06-15', INTERVAL 4 WEEK) THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS total_sales_after
FROM clean_weekly_sales
) AS sales_before_and_after;
```

#### What about the entire 12 weeks before and after?

```sql
SELECT total_sales_before, 
       total_sales_after,
       (total_sales_before - total_sales_after) AS sales_difference,
       ROUND(((total_sales_after - total_sales_before) / total_sales_before) * 100, 1) AS growth_rate
FROM (SELECT
    SUM(CASE WHEN week_date BETWEEN DATE_SUB('2020-06-15', INTERVAL 12 WEEK) AND '2020-06-15' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS total_sales_before,
    SUM(CASE WHEN week_date BETWEEN '2020-06-15' AND DATE_ADD('2020-06-15', INTERVAL 12 WEEK) THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS total_sales_after
FROM clean_weekly_sales
) AS sales_before_and_after;
```
