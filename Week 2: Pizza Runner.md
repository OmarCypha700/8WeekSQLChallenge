## B. Runner and Customer Experience

##### 1. How many runners signed up for each 1 week period? (i.e. week starts 2021-01-01)
```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(week FROM registration_date + INTERVAL 3 day) AS week, 
	   MIN(registration_date) AS start_week,
	   COUNT(*) AS sign_ups
FROM pizza_runner.runners
GROUP BY week
ORDER BY week;
```
 week         | start_week     | sign_ups
:------------:|:--------------:|------------
 1            | 2021-01-01     | 2
 2            | 2021-01-08     | 1
 3            | 2021-01-15     | 1
 
##### 2. What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?
```sql
SELECT ro.runner_id, 
	   CAST(AVG(TIMEDIFF(ro.pickup_time, co.order_time)) AS TIME) AS avg_time
FROM pizza_runner.runner_orders AS ro
JOIN pizza_runner.customer_orders AS co
USING (order_id)
GROUP BY ro.runner_id;
```
runner_id   |	avg_time
------------|------------
1	    |	00:15:54
2	    |	00:23:59
3	    |	00:10:28

##### 3. Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?
```sql
SELECT num_pizzas, CAST(AVG(prep_time) AS TIME)AS avg_prep_time
FROM (
	SELECT co.order_id, COUNT(co.pizza_id) as num_pizzas, 
		   CAST(TIMEDIFF(ro.pickup_time, co.order_time) AS TIME) AS prep_time
	FROM pizza_runner.runner_orders ro
	JOIN pizza_runner.customer_orders co
	USING (order_id)
	WHERE ro.pickup_time IS NOT NULL
	GROUP BY co.order_id, ro.pickup_time, co.order_time
) AS sub
GROUP BY num_pizzas;
```
runner_id   |	avg_time
------------|------------
1	    |	00:12:21
2	    |	00:18:23
3	    |	'00:29:17'

Looking at the average time taken and the number of pizzas prepared within that time, there seem to be a relationship between the number of pizzas and how long it takes to prepare.

##### 4. What was the average distance travelled for each customer?
```sql
SELECT co.customer_id, CEIL(AVG(distance_km)) AS avg_distance_km
FROM pizza_runner.runner_orders AS ro
JOIN pizza_runner.customer_orders AS co
USING (order_id)
GROUP BY co.customer_id;
```
 customer_id  |	avg_distance_km
------------- |-----------------
101	      | 20
102	      |	17
103	      |	24
104	      |	10
105	      | 25

##### 5. What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?
```sql
SELECT (MAX(duration_min) - MIN(duration_min)) AS diff
FROM pizza_runner.runner_orders;
```
| diff |
|------|
| 30   |

##### 6. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?
```sql
SELECT runner_id, 
	   CEIL(AVG(distance_km / (duration_min/60))) AS 'avg_speed_km/hr'
FROM pizza_runner.runner_orders
GROUP BY runner_id;
```
runner_id  |	avg_speed_km/hr
-----------|------------------
1	   |	46
2	   |	63
3	   |	40

##### 7. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?
```sql
SELECT runner_id,
       COUNT(*) AS total_deliveries,
       SUM(CASE WHEN cancellation IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS successful_deliveries,
       (SUM(CASE WHEN cancellation IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*)) * 100 AS success_percentage
FROM pizza_runner.runner_orders
GROUP BY runner_id;
```
runner_id   |	total_deliveries     |	successful_deliveries | success_percentage
------------|------------------------|------------------------|--------------------
1	    |	     4		     |	      4		      |	   100.0000
2	    |	     4		     |	      3		      |    75.0000
3	    |	     2		     |	      1		      |    50.0000


## C. INGREDIENT OPTIMIZATION

##### 1. What are the standard ingredients for each pizza?
```sql
SELECT prc.pizza_id,
		GROUP_CONCAT(pt.topping_name SEPARATOR ', ') AS toppings
FROM pizza_recipes_clean AS prc
JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_toppings AS pt
ON prc.toppings = pt.topping_id
GROUP BY prc.pizza_id;
```
pizza_id    |	toppings
------------|------------
1	    | Bacon, BBQ Sauce, Beef, Cheese, Chicken, Mushrooms, Pepperoni, Salami
2	    | Cheese, Mushrooms, Onions, Peppers, Tomatoes, Tomato Sauce

##### 2. What was the most commonly added extra?
```sql
SELECT coc.extras,
       pt.topping_name,
       COUNT(DISTINCT coc.row_number) AS count
FROM customer_orders_cleaned AS coc
JOIN pizza_toppings AS pt
ON coc.extras = pt.topping_id
GROUP BY extras, topping_name
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
extras | topping_name | count
-------|--------------|------
1      | Bacon	      |	4

##### 3. What was the most common exclusion?
```sql
SELECT coc.exclusions,
       pt.topping_name,
       COUNT(DISTINCT coc.row_number) AS count
FROM customer_orders_cleaned AS coc
JOIN pizza_toppings AS pt
ON coc.exclusions = pt.topping_id
GROUP BY exclusions, topping_name
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
exclusions | topping_name | count
-----------|--------------|------
4          | Cheese	  | 4

##### 4. Generate an order item for each record in the customers_orders table in the format of one of the following:
- Meat Lovers
- Meat Lovers - Exclude Beef
- Meat Lovers - Extra Bacon
- Meat Lovers - Exclude Cheese, Bacon - Extra Mushroom, Peppers

```sql

##### 6. What is the total quantity of each ingredient used in all delivered pizzas sorted by most frequent first?

```sql
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Create a temporary table 'new_recipe' that shows pizza_id, topping_id and topping_name from pizza_recipe and pizza_toppings table
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DROP TEMPORARY TABLE IF EXISTS new_recipe;

);


WITH total_ingredients AS (
  SELECT 
    nco.row_number,
    nr.topping_name,
    CASE
      -- if extra ingredient, add 2
      WHEN nr.topping_id IN (
          SELECT extra_id 
          FROM extras_seperated es
          WHERE es.row_number = nco.row_number)

  BBQ Sauce    | 9 
  Tomatoes     | 4
  Onions       | 4
  Peppers      | 4
  Tomato Sauce | 4

## D. PRICING AND RATES

##### 1. If a Meat Lovers pizza costs $12 and Vegetarian costs $10 and there were no charges for changes - how much money has Pizza Runner made so far if there are no delivery fees?
```sql
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN pizza_id = 1 THEN 12
		WHEN pizza_id = 2 THEN 10
           END) AS money_made
FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders
JOIN pizza_runner.runner_orders USING (order_id)
WHERE cancellation IS NULL;
```
 money_made
:---------:
  138

##### 2. What if there was an additional $1 charge for any pizza extras?
- Add cheese is $1 extra
```sql
WITH price1_CTE AS (
	SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN pizza_id = 1 THEN 12 ELSE 10 END) AS 'money_made'
	FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders
	JOIN pizza_runner.runner_orders USING (order_id)
	WHERE cancellation IS NULL
),
price2_CTE AS (
	SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN extras = 4 THEN 2 ELSE 1 END) AS 'extras_charged'
	FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders_cleaned
	JOIN pizza_runner.runner_orders USING (order_id)
	WHERE cancellation IS NULL
    AND extras IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT (money_made + extras_charged) AS adjusted_money_made
FROM price1_CTE, price2_CTE;
```
 adjusted_money_made
:-------------------:
  146

##### 3. The Pizza Runner team now wants to add an additional ratings system that allows customers to rate their runner, how would you design an additional table for this new dataset - generate a schema for this new table and insert your own data for ratings for each successful customer order between 1 to 5.
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS runner_ratings;
CREATE TABLE pizza_runner.runner_ratings (
  order_id INT,
  rating INT
);
INSERT INTO pizza_runner.runner_ratings (order_id, rating)
VALUES 
  (1,5),
  (2,3),
  (3,2),
  (4,4),
  (5,2),
  (7,3),
  (8,4),
  (10,5);

SELECT * FROM pizza_runner.runner_ratings;
```
order_id    |	rating
------------|---------
1           |	5
2	    |   3
3	    |   2
4	    |   4
5	    |   2
7	    |   3
8	    |   4
10	    |   5

##### 4. Using your newly generated table - can you join all of the information together to form a table which has the following information for successful deliveries?
- customer_id
- order_id
- runner_id
- rating
- order_time
- pickup_time
- Time between order and pickup
- Delivery duration
- Average speed
- Total number of pizzas

```sql
SELECT 
      co.customer_id,
      co.order_id,
      ro.runner_id,
      rr.rating,
      co.order_time,
      ro.pickup_time,
      CAST(TIMEDIFF(ro.pickup_time, co.order_time) AS TIME) AS 'time_btwn_order_&_pickup',
      ro.duration_min,
      CEIL(AVG(distance_km / (duration_min/60))) AS 'avg_speed_km/hr',
      COUNT(pizza_id) AS num_pizzas

##### 5. If a Meat Lovers pizza was $12 and Vegetarian $10 fixed prices with no cost for extras and each runner is paid $0.30 per kilometre traveled 
- how much money does Pizza Runner have left over after these deliveries?

```sql
WITH income_CTE AS (
	SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN c.pizza_id = 1 THEN 12 ELSE 10 END) AS money_made
	 FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders c
	 INNER JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_names pn
	 ON c.pizza_id = pn.pizza_id
	 INNER JOIN pizza_runner.runner_orders r
	 ON c.order_id = r.order_id
	 WHERE r.cancellation IS NULL
     ),
expense_CTE AS(
SELECT SUM((distance_km * 0.30)) AS total_driver_fee
FROM pizza_runner.runner_orders
WHERE distance_km IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT ROUND(money_made - total_driver_fee, 2) AS leftover_amt
FROM income_CTE, expense_CTE;
```
 leftover_amt
:--------------:
  94.44
